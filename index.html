        1Ô∏è‚É£<b>React & Features</b> - Created by <u> Jordan Walke </u>, software
        engineer in FB , and first deployed in the FB Newsfeed and later in
        Whatsapp & Instagram. <br />
        It is an open source library developed by facebook in 2011. It is used
        to create <u>single page applications</u> by following component based
        approach by creating <u>reusable UI components</u> . It is used for
        developing interactive view layer of web and mobile applications. <br />
        Features of react include: <br />
        i) Virtual DOM <br />
        ii) JSX <br />
        iii) Components which can be reused. <br />
        iv) One way data Binding <br />
        v) Good community support <br />
        vi) Easy learning curve

        2Ô∏è‚É£<b>Virtual DOM</b> - Whenever an application gets loaded in the
        browser a Document Object Model is created, In which each element is
        treated as an object. When a react application is loaded and the react
        components are mounted, virtual dom is created. It is a
        <u>lightweight copy of the actual DOM</u>. <br />
        When any user makes changes which leads to state updation, the changes
        will go to virtual dom. <br />
        React has two virtual dom, one virtual dom gets created at the time of
        mounting of react component so it is a copy of your real dom. Another
        virtual dom is the dom which contains the new changes, updated state
        variables values. Now these two virtual doms will get compared with each
        other and will check for the new changes. this complete procedure is
        known as <u>diffing algorithm</u>. Now the new changes will be updated
        in your Real dom. this procedure is known as <u>Recoinciliation</u>.

      <li>
        3Ô∏è‚É£ <b>Diffing Algorithm</b> - Whenever there is a change in the state of
        the UI elements, a new virtual DOM is created. Then the new virtual DOM
        and the previous <u>virtual DOM are compared</u> with each other. This
        comparing is called DOM diffing.

        4Ô∏è‚É£ <b>React Vs Vue Vs Angular</b> - React is a <u>JS Library</u>.
        Library is a set of reusable functions used by computer programs.
        Framework is a piece of code that dictates the architecture of a
        project. <br />
        Library is called by the code, but in framework, framework calls the
        code. We can control the data flow in library using methods, but in
        framework we do not have any control over the data flow. It decides the
        data flow which is nothing but it calls the code. Performance-wise ,
        React is much much better than Angular and Vue. br React has an
        <u>easy learning curve</u>, and it helps to make <u>SPA</u>. It consists
        of <u>Virtual DOM</u> and It has a <u>great community support</u> which
        means that whenever you get stuck somewhere, you can get solutions to
        your code almost instantly.

        5Ô∏è‚É£ <b>Functional Vs Class Components</b> - i) Class Components uses
        <u>lifecycle methods</u> while Functional Components use <u>hooks</u>.
        <br />
        ii) Class Components are called <u>stateful components</u> and
        Functional Components are called <u>stateless components</u>. <br />
        iii) <u>render function</u> in Class Components is present, while
        Functional Components only consists of <u>return</u>. <br />
        iv)Class Components accept <u>state and props</u> both, while Functional
        Components accepts <u>only props</u> as an argument. <br />
        v) Class Components have <u>complex code structure</u> which can be hard
        to read and write while Functional Components are
        <u>simple to use</u> and easy to read and write. <br />
        vi) <u>this keyword</u> is used in Class Components but not in
        Functional Components.

        6Ô∏è‚É£<b>Stateful Vs Stateless Components</b> - In React, a stateful
        component is a component that <u>holds some state</u>.They are also
        called <u>smart components/Class Components</u>.They can be reused. <br />
        Stateless components, by contrast, have <u>no state</u>. Both types of
        components can use props. They are also called
        <u>dumb components/Functional Components</u> and are easy to understand.They do not work with
        react lifecycle.
      </li>
      <br />
      <hr />
      <li>7Ô∏è‚É£<b>Phases of React component Lifecycle</b> - In ReactJS, every component creation process involves various lifecycle methods. These lifecycle methods are termed as <u>component's lifecycle</u>. These lifecycle methods are not very complicated and called at various points during a component's life. The lifecycle of the component is divided into four phases. They are: <br>
        1.	<u>Initial Phase</u> <br>
        2.	<u>Mounting Phase</u> <br>
        3.	<u>Updating Phase</u> <br>
        4.	<u>Unmounting Phase</u> <br>
        Each phase contains some lifecycle methods that are specific to the particular phase
        </li>
      <li>8Ô∏è‚É£<b>Single Page Application Vs Multi Page Application</b> - The idea is that the website loads all the HTML/JS the first time you visit. When you then navigate, the browser will only <u>rerender the content</u> without refreshing the website. <u>React Router</u> is a great way to build single-page applications because you prevent a page refresh every time a link is clicked. With <u>client-side rendering</u>, the page doesn't refresh as you navigate through the different links. <br> Multiple-page applications work in a ‚Äútraditional‚Äù way. Every change eg. display the data or submit data back to server requests rendering a new page from the server in the browser. These applications are large, bigger than SPAs because they need to be. Due to the amount of content, these applications have many levels of UI. <br> i) MPA slow speed <br> ii)Reusable code in SPA , while code from scratch in SPA <br> iii)SPA is easily maintained. <br> iv)Acc to SEO, SPA has limited optimization. <br>v)SPA is smooth and user friendly. <br> vi)SPA secures endpoints.</li>

      <li>9Ô∏è‚É£<b>State Vs Props</b> - State is the local state of the component which cannot be accessed and modified outside of the component. It's equivalent to local variables in a function. <br> Props, on the other hand, make components reusable by giving components the ability to receive data from their parent component in the form of props. <br> Props are read-only.	State changes can be asynchronous. <br>i) Props are immutable.	State is mutable. <br>ii) Props allow you to pass data from one component to other components as an argument.	State holds information about the components. <br>iii) Props can be accessed by the child component.	State cannot be accessed by child components. <br>iv) Props are used to communicate between components.	States can be used for rendering dynamic changes with the component. <br>v) Stateless component can have Props.	Stateless components cannot have State. <br>vi) Props make components reusable.	State cannot make components reusable. <br>vii)	Props are external and controlled by whatever renders the component.	The State is internal and controlled by the React Component itself.

      <li>üîü<b>Props Drilling and State Uplifting</b> -It refers to the process you have to go through to get data to parts of the React Component tree.The problem with this approach is that most of the components through which this data is passed have no actual need for this data. They are simply used as mediums for transporting this data to its destination component. <br>The Context API basically lets you broadcast your state/data to multiple components by wrapping them with a context provider. It then passes this state to the context provider using its value attribute. The children components can then tap into this provider using a context consumer or the useContext Hook when needed, and access the state provided by the context provider. <br> Often there will be a need to share state between different components. The common approach to share state between two components is to move the state to common parent of the two components. This approach is called as lifting state up in React.js . With the shared state, changes in state reflect in relevant components simultaneously. This is a single source of truth for shared state components.</li>

      <li>1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£<b>Controlled Vs Uncontrolled Components</b> -Controlled components in React are those in which form data is handled by the component's state. Forms are used to store information in a document section. The information from this form is typically sent to a server to perform an action.This data is held by form input elements and control elements, such as input, select, textarea, etc., which maintain and control their states or values. <br> Uncontrolled components are those for which the form data is handled by the DOM itself. ‚ÄúUncontrolled‚Äù refers to the fact that these components are not controlled by React state.The values of the form elements are traditionally controlled by and stored on the DOM. We will have to refer to the instance of the form elements to retrieve their values from the DOM. <br> i) Controlled components are predictable because the state of the form elements is handled by the component <br>ii)Uncontrolled components are not predictable because, during the lifecycle of a component, the form elements can lose their reference and may be changed/affected by other sources <br>iii)Controlled components enable you to effectively employ form validation to your forms. It doesn‚Äôt matter what changes the form elements. Their values are safe in our local states, so that‚Äôs where we perform our validation <br> iv) With controlled components, you are very much in control of your form elements‚Äô values. You can dictate how they go and what can and cannot be inserted</li>

      <li>1Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£<b>React Router</b> - Routing is a process in which a user is directed to different pages based on their action or request. ReactJS Router is mainly used for developing Single Page Web Applications. React Router is used to define multiple routes in the application. When a user types a specific URL into the browser, and if this URL path matches any 'route' inside the router file, the user will be redirected to that particular route. <br> React Router is a standard library system built on top of the React and used to create routing in the React application using React Router Package. It provides the synchronous URL on the browser with data that will be displayed on the web page. It maintains the standard structure and behavior of the application and mainly used for developing single page web applications. <br> React Router plays an important role to display multiple views in a single page application. Without React Router, it is not possible to display multiple views in React applications. Most of the social media websites like Facebook, Instagram uses React Router for rendering multiple views.</li>
